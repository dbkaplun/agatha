My 2007 BMW 335xi

## Goals
* Safety first
* Daily driveability is more important than performance characteristics. Be comfortable and luxurious as a BMW should be
* Don't break down. When that fails, be cheaply maintainable
* Handle any terrain well -- pavement, potholes, rain, snow, ice, gravel
* Avoid attracting unwanted attention (police, thieves)
* Be fast as hell
